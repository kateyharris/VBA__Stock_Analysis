# stock-analysis
## Overview of Project: 
- Our client, Steve, has requested a stock market analysis for the entire stock market and would like a easy button, similar to the one provided for the "All Stocks Analysis" workbook analyizing just 12 stocks.
- Using refactoring of the code behind the button to run faster, and handle a larger set of data, a new workbook allows for analysis of a larger data set.
- Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
- Below shows pre-rectoring macro for "All Stocks Analysis"

## Summary: 
- In a summary statement, address the following questions.
